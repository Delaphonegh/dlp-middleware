# Quality Assurance Evidence Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive quality assurance evidence tracking to replace technical field names with human-readable explanations and provide specific call identifiers for conversation tracking and listening.

## Problem Addressed
**Before:** Evidence used technical jargon that was not actionable for quality assurance teams:
```json
{
  "evidence": {
    "data_source": "transcripts.content analysis, transcript_analysis.custom_topic",
    "supporting_data": "field_name",
    "sample_records": ["source_numbers"]
  }
}
```

**After:** Evidence provides trackable, actionable information:
```json
{
  "evidence": {
    "human_explanation": "Analysis of customer sentiment in technical support conversations revealed elevated frustration levels",
    "call_examples": [
      {
        "call_id": "CDR_2024_001234",
        "customer_phone": "555-123-4567",
        "date_time": "January 15, 2024 at 2:30 PM EST",
        "recording_url": "https://recordings.company.com/call_001234.wav",
        "why_relevant": "Customer explicitly expressed dissatisfaction with technical support response time"
      }
    ],
    "data_explanation": "Analyzed customer sentiment scores from call transcripts, focusing on emotional indicators",
    "technical_source": "transcript_analysis.sentiment_score, transcript_analysis.topics"
  }
}
```

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Requirements
**Files Modified:**
- `src/prompts/bi_analysis_system_prompt.txt`
- `src/prompts/bi_analysis_user_prompt.txt`

**New Requirements Added:**
- **Call ID**: Unique identifier for traceability
- **Customer Phone**: Source phone number for customer identification
- **Recording URL**: Direct link to call recording for listening
- **Date/Time**: Exact timestamp for context
- **Human-Readable Explanation**: Clear description instead of technical jargon
- **Why Relevant**: Specific reason why each call supports the insight

### 2. QA Evidence Processing System
**File:** `src/utils/llm.py`

**New Methods Added:**
- `_prepare_qa_evidence()`: Extracts and categorizes call examples for evidence
- `_generate_recording_url()`: Creates recording URLs for call playback
- Enhanced prompt injection with QA evidence data

**Categories of Evidence:**
- High volume calls for general analysis
- Long duration calls for efficiency analysis
- Calls with available recordings
- Repeat callers for service quality assessment

### 3. Automatic Recording URL Generation
**URL Formats Supported:**
- Existing recording files: `https://recordings.company.com/recordings/2024/01/15/call_001234.wav`
- Placeholder URLs: `https://recordings.company.com/call_CDR_2024_001234.wav`
- Full URLs passed through unchanged

### 4. JSON Schema Updates
**All Evidence Sections Now Include:**
```json
{
  "evidence": {
    "human_explanation": "Clear business description",
    "call_examples": [
      {
        "call_id": "CDR_2024_001234",
        "customer_phone": "555-123-4567", 
        "date_time": "January 15, 2024 at 2:30 PM EST",
        "recording_url": "https://recordings.company.com/call_001234.wav",
        "why_relevant": "Specific reason this call supports the insight"
      }
    ],
    "data_explanation": "Methodology used to analyze data",
    "technical_source": "field_name, database_table.column"
  }
}
```

## Quality Assurance Benefits

### For QA Teams:
1. **Call Tracking**: Locate specific calls using unique identifiers
2. **Recording Access**: Direct links to call recordings for listening
3. **Customer Follow-up**: Phone numbers for customer contact
4. **Context Understanding**: Exact timestamps for situational awareness
5. **Business Language**: Clear explanations instead of technical terms
6. **Validation**: Specific calls that support each AI insight

### For Management:
1. **Insight Verification**: Can listen to actual calls that support recommendations
2. **Agent Coaching**: Identify specific examples for training purposes
3. **Customer Service**: Follow up on specific customer issues
4. **Process Improvement**: Track patterns across specific conversations

## Integration Points

### 1. Automatic Prompt Enhancement
- QA evidence automatically prepared from call data
- Evidence examples injected into BI analysis prompts
- No manual configuration required

### 2. Response Validation
- All insights must include trackable evidence
- Recording URLs provided for verification
- Human-readable explanations required

### 3. Fallback Support
- Works with or without recording files
- Generates placeholder URLs when recordings unavailable
- Handles various call ID formats

## Testing

### Test Coverage:
- **Recording URL Generation**: Various file formats and URL types
- **QA Evidence Preparation**: Call categorization and example extraction
- **Prompt Integration**: Evidence injection into analysis prompts
- **Format Demonstration**: Expected response structure

### Test Results:
```
✅ Recording URL generation working correctly
✅ QA evidence preparation successful
✅ 4 calls with recordings identified
✅ Call examples properly categorized
✅ Prompt integration functional
✅ Human-readable format demonstrated
```

## Examples

### Before Enhancement:
```json

    "call_count": 67,
    "evidence": {
      "data_source": "cdr.dst field analysis",
      "source_numbers": ["555-0123", "555-0124"],
      "query_basis": "SELECT dst, COUNT(*) FROM cdr"
    }
