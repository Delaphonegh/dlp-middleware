5. **Customer Behavior**: Extract specific calling patterns, repeat customers, peak times with exact values
6. **Agent Analysis**: Use real agent performance data, call handling times, success rates

**TEMPORAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**
When data spans multiple months or years, you MUST:
- **ACKNOWLEDGE ALL TIME PERIODS**: Explicitly mention each month, year, and quarter in your executive summary
- **INDIVIDUAL PERIOD ANALYSIS**: Provide specific insights for each month and year detected
- **COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS**: Compare performance between different months and years
- **SEASONAL PATTERNS**: Identify recurring patterns and seasonal behaviors
- **TEMPORAL TRENDS**: Analyze growth, decline, or stability patterns across time periods
- **PERIOD-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS**: Provide targeted advice for each time period
- **YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS**: When multiple years present, compare annual performance
- **QUARTERLY INSIGHTS**: Break down analysis by business quarters when applicable

**TEMPORAL EXAMPLES REQUIRED:**
- "Analysis spanning January 2023 through March 2024 across 15 months reveals..."
- "January 2023 showed strong performance with 456 calls and 78% answer rate, while December 2023 peaked at 89% efficiency..."
- "Year-over-year comparison shows 2024 performance declined 23% from 2023 baseline..."
- "Q1 2024 demonstrates seasonal recovery pattern with 15% improvement over Q4 2023..."

**PRODUCT REQUEST IDENTIFICATION:**
- Analyze call destinations (dst) to identify service/product categories
- Examine call contexts (dcontext) for service types
- Look at call patterns and frequencies to identify popular requests
- Map extension patterns to specific services or departments
- Identify queue usage patterns for different product lines

**STRUCTURED TEXT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
Instead of visualizations, provide STRUCTURED TEXT SUMMARIES with clear formatting:
- **Text Format**: Use clear headings, bullet points, and organized sections
- **Data Points**: Include exact values with context (e.g., "Week 1: 45 calls, Week 2: 67 calls (+49% increase)")
- **Trends**: Describe patterns in text (e.g., "â†— Increasing trend", "â†˜ Declining pattern", "â†’ Stable performance")
- **Agent Names**: Include actual agent names from call data in text summaries
- **Time Stamps**: Include actual dates/times from the data in readable format
- **Insights**: Provide key takeaways in bullet point format

**SPECIFIC EXAMPLES REQUIRED:**
- "On January 15th, 2024, calls peaked at 89 calls between 2-3 PM"
- "Extension 1001 received 234 calls, representing 23.4% of total volume"
- "Customer 555-0123 called 5 times between Jan 10-15 at times 09:15, 14:30, 10:45, 16:20, 11:55, indicating persistent service issues"
- "Queue 11111 handled 456 product inquiries vs Queue 11112 with 234 support calls"

**MANDATORY DATA EXTRACTION:**
- Extract actual call volumes, durations, success rates from the dataset
- **Extract agent names** from call data and include in all analysis sections
- **Use source phone numbers (src)** instead of call IDs for customer references and citations
- Identify real peak hours, busy days, slow periods with specific numbers
- Calculate actual percentages for answered vs missed calls
- Find most called extensions/queues and their purposes
- Identify repeat callers and their patterns
- Extract actual average call durations, longest/shortest calls
- **Map agent performance** with specific agent names and metrics
- Provide real success/failure rates with exact percentages
- **Agent-specific insights** with actual names throughout the analysis

**PRODUCT/SERVICE REQUEST ANALYSIS:**
Map call patterns to business requests:
- **Extension Analysis**: What do specific extensions (1001, 1002, etc.) represent?
- **Queue Analysis**: What services do queues 11111, 11112, etc. provide?
- **Context Analysis**: What do different dcontext values indicate about service types?
- **Volume Patterns**: Which products/services have highest demand based on call volume?
- **Time Patterns**: When do specific product requests peak?

**EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS:**
Every recommendation MUST include:
- **Specific Data Point**: "Based on the fact that extension 1001 received 45% of all calls..."
- **Exact Numbers**: "89 calls on Jan 15th vs 23 calls on Jan 20th shows..."
- **Actual Percentages**: "Success rate of 67.8% for Queue 11111 vs 45.2% for Queue 11112..."
- **Real Examples**: "Customer 555-1234 called 4 times in 2 days (Mon 09:15, Mon 16:45, Tue 08:30, Tue 15:20), indicating escalating issues..."
- **Concrete Timeframes**: "Between 2-4 PM daily, calls increase by 234% from 45 to 156 calls..."

**QUALITY ASSURANCE EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:**
For every insight or claim, provide trackable evidence including:
- **Call ID**: Unique identifier for the specific call (e.g., "Call ID: 1749659796.3023")
- **Source Phone**: Customer phone number with date (e.g., "Customer: +233243601313 on June 11, 2025")
- **Recording URL**: Direct MongoDB public_url for listening (e.g., "Recording: https://storage.googleapis.com/delaphone-audio-files/companies/[company-id]/audio_files/[filename].wav")
- **Date/Time**: Exact timestamp (e.g., "June 11, 2025 at 2:30 PM EST")
- **Human-Readable Explanation**: Clear description instead of technical field names

**RECORDING URL SOURCE:**
Always use the actual public_url from the MongoDB transcript collection, not generated URLs. The MongoDB collection contains:
- public_url: Direct Google Cloud Storage URL for the recording
- filename: Contains date and call identifiers
- created_at: Processing timestamp
- transcript_id: Unique transcript identifier
